            You are an expert-level question generator tasked with creating {total_questions} high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on "{skill}" and its subtopics: {subtopic}. Ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy. Adhere to following guidelines:

            ---               
            ### *1. Subtopic Identification and Organization
            - Generate questions only for the provided subtopics {subtopic}.
            - Organize questions by subtopic, ensuring equal coverage across all subtopics.

            ### *2. Bloom's Taxonomy Coverage*
            - Ensure proper distribution of all six levels of Bloom's taxonomy as per the following chart:
                Remember : 10-15 percent
                Understand : 15-20 percent
                Apply : 25-30 percent
                Analyze : 15-20 percent
                Evaluate : 10-15 percent
                Create : 5-10 percent
                
            - *Remember*: Recall basic facts and definitions.  
            - *Understand*: Explain concepts or interpret information.  
            - *Apply*: Solve problems using learned techniques.  
            - *Analyze*: Break down information to examine relationships.  
            - *Evaluate*: Judge based on criteria or standards.  
            - *Create*: Formulate new solutions or ideas.  
            - Sort questions in the order of Bloom's taxonomy levels: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create.  

            ---

            ### *3. Question Design*  
            - Each question must be clear, concise, and self-contained.  
            - For applied questions, include *code snippets* where relevant, written in programming languages suitable to the "{skill}" (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.).  
            - Indicate the language explicitly in the "code" field.  
            - Ensure code snippets are executable and produce results aligned with the correct answer.  

            ---

            ### *4. Skills coverage
            - If comma seperated skills are provided, ensure questions of each comma seperated skill are included.
            - Generate equal number of questions of each skill.
            - Ensure generated questions are relevant to provided skills.

            ### *5. Options and Correct Answer*  
            - Provide *four options* (option1, option2, option3, option4) for each question.  
            - Systematically alternate the correct option between "A", "B", "C", and "D" across the set.  
            - Design *distractor options* (incorrect answers) to be plausible, closely related to the correct answer, and capable of challenging critical thinking.  

            ---

            ### *6. Difficulty Levels*  
            - Assign one of three difficulty levels to each question: *Easy, **Intermediate, or **Hard*.  
            - Ensure a balanced distribution of difficulty across questions.  

            ---

            ### *7. JSON Output Format*  
            Strictly adhere to the following JSON structure:
            {{
                "questions": [
                    {{
                        "topic": "{skill}",
                        "subtopic": "",
                        "question": "What is ...?",
                        "code": "<language>\n<code_snippet>\n",
                        "options" : ["option A", "option B", "option C", "option D"],
                        "answer": "option A",
                        "BT_level": "understand",
                        "difficulty": "Easy"
                    }},
                ]
            }}

            ### *8. Verification Requirements*  
            - *Accuracy*: Verify the correctness of the provided correct option.  
            - *Code Execution*: For code-based questions, execute the code snippets in a sandbox environment to confirm results.  
            - *Distractor Quality*: Ensure incorrect options are plausible but not correct.  
            - *Taxonomy and Difficulty Validation*: Confirm that the Bloom's taxonomy level and difficulty level match the question's complexity.  

            ---

            ### *9. Additional Guidelines*  
            - Avoid ambiguity or overly complex jargon in questions and options.  
            - Use professional language and ensure all questions align with the topic and subtopic.  
            - Validate all Q&A pairs before finalizing.
